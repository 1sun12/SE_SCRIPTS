# SE_SCRIPTS
A collection of scripts and projects I have collected over time for the reputable game, "Space Engineers".

Please visit the following links which will take you to "Malforge's MDK2", a helpful wiki and SDK to get started. 

- https://github.com/malforge/mdk2
- https://malforge.github.io/spaceengineers/mdk2/Getting-Started-using-VSCode.html

After setup, type:
`dotnet new mdk2pbscript -n MyFirstScript -o MyFirstScript` to create your first script! (Assuming you installed Malforge's MDK2)
